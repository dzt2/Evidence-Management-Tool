Evidence-Management-Tool
========================

Modeling data verification tool by using first-order logic language
This tools should provide user the interface of UML modeling and data importing.
Any data imported into the model could be provided to data verification interface which check whether the data satisfies some specific safety claim. The tool allows user to describe evidence model and safety claim themselves. The safety claim is described by using first-order logical language (provide APIs).

The tool is in design and I will start development in Jun 10th.
